this page is mainly about the use of dichotomy and the greedy algorithm to solve some of the algorithm problems.

the common characteristics of the problem is that for a given set, you divide them into m sub-groups, and you will need to find the minimum of such maximum of distances between each of the

here we will first introduce you one problem that is called the "Frog Cross the River"
